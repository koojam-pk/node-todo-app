# Todos App
=========

This is a simple Todo app. It is based on the Udemy course, Projects in ExpressJS - Learn ExpressJs building 10 projects. It's demonstrated how to build up the project from scratch, npm init. In the course, mongodb client driver was used. In this project, I have used mongoose driver instead. It provides an abstraction layer on top of MongoDB that eliminates the need to use named collections. It uses models to perform bulk of work of establishing up default values for document properties and validating data. Functions can be attached to the model that allows for seamless incorporation of new functionality. The queries use function chaining rather than embedded mnemonics which result code that is more flexible and readable, it result in more maintainable.

What can be learnt from the course
- Build the project from scratch, npm init.
- Use bower to create the dependency package for front-end use.
- Use ejs for front-end webpage. The concept is similar to php concept where the page layout can be splitted into separate files.

What I have done when going through the course
- Use Mongoose instead of MongoDB Client driver
- Separate the routing section into files, app and todos. I have rewritten the CRUD 
- Use the latest bootstrap version
